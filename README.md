# GradeTrackerGUI
This is a rudimentary GUI that is based on existing class demo material, specifically GradeTracker. User input will be added to an excel file that a person will be able to keep track of throughout a semester of IS3020. This particular GUI will track Python 1: Absoloute Beginner and Python 2: Fundamentals.
